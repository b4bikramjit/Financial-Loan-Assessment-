# Finanacial Loan Assessment Project 

This data analysis project focuses on creating a comprehensive report on a bank's lending activities and performance through the development of an Excel dashboard. The primary tool used is Microsoft Excel, where Pivot Charts, KPIs, and Slicers are employed to gain insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time.


## Objective
The goal is to monitor and assess the bank's lending activities, providing insights into key loan-related metrics to make data-driven decisions and inform lending strategies.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes a bank data based on loan staus of different persons. It consists of 38577 rows and 25 columns.
## Tools and Techniques
1. This project is purely made with MS Excel.
2. Used filters and if-else conditions for data cleaning.
3. Used KPI's, slicers, links, pivot tables and charts for dashboard creation.

## Project Structure
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

1. Total Loan Applications:

Calculate the total number of loan applications during a specified period.
Monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

2. Total Funded Amount:

Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
Track Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Funded Amount and analyze MoM changes.

3. Total Amount Received:

Track the total amount received from borrowers.
Analyze Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe MoM changes.

4. Average Interest Rate:

Calculate the average interest rate across all loans.
Monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) average interest rate and track MoM variations.

5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):

Evaluate the average DTI for all borrowers.
Compute Month-to-Month (MTD) average DTI and track MoM fluctuations.
